        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a master's student majoring in Materials and Chemical Engineering at the University of Science and Technology of China, with an expected graduation in June 2024. Currently, I serve as a graduate research assistant at the Key Laboratory of Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Smart Systems at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, focusing on research inkjet 3D printing processes. Before this, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Materials Forming and Control Engineering from Hefei University of Technology. I have a background in 3D Printing, Printable Electronics and Mechanical Design.</p>
        <p>My research interests primarily include functional microsystem 3D printing, wearable electronic products, and soft 3D micro-mechanics. I am dedicated to utilizing novel additive manufacturing processes for fabricating micro and nanostructures, and I am enthusiastic about designing, building, and observing new manufacturing processes.</p>
